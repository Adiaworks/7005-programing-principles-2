<h4>2. Describe what you were able to complete, what you were not able to complete.</h4>
<p>
I thought I should be able to structure the user interface of the assignment 2 in a better way. <br>
But I spent too much time on figuring out the logic and coding, therefore, I did not present <br>
the user interface as good as possible.<br>
At the beginning of this assignment, I donâ€™t think I can complete all the tasks of the assignment 2. <br>
But I almost done all the requirements.
</p>
<h4>3. Reflect on the process you have applied to develop your solution.</h4>
<p>
I started the assignment from the ERD. And I thought about the structure of my website.<br> 
I spent a lot of time on working out the relationships between tables. I tested each<br>
 route and function repeatedly. I used dd() and var_dump() to test my code,  which is<br> 
 helpful. When I had problems, I checked the weekly exercises firstly and I found <br>
lecture videos are also helpful. If the lecture video did not solve my problems, I would<br>
do research online. 
</p>
<h4>4. Recommendation feature </h4>
<p>
Based on the followings of the logged in user, I retrieved all users and their reviews and then got<br>
all item ids of those reviews. Sorted all the item ids in their numbers of occurrences in the descending  <br>
order. I got top three items to show up in the item recommendation section. <br>
According to items recommended, only three items will be recommended, therefore only three review's <br>
users with most likes will be recommended.
